        <p> Instagram is not what it used to be 3 years ago. To successfully grow a personal brand on Instagram, you need to have a clear strategy and a roadmap! And that's exactly what we'll teach you at the IG Creator Retreat/Bootcamp, based on our own experiences and successes. </p>

    <h3 class="col-12 centered">Part of you is like, I'M SO IN SIGN ME UP, but then the other part of you still has some doubts… Does this sound like you?</h3>
  <div class="grid service-text left">

    <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded editable" data-cms-source="/index.html" data-cms-index="6">
      <h5> But... I'm scared it won't work for me</h5>
      <p>You're asking the wrong question! Instead of asking, "What if it won't work for me?" ask "What if it does work for me?!".</p>
      <p>Look, we know that investing in a retreat/bootcamp can be really scary. Wow, we were all so terrified when we first invested in ourselves. We've used our last dimes to pay for courses, but we dove into this new world of social media learning and the results speak for themselves.</p>
      <p>Here's the thing: we believe in taking mentorship from people who are where you want to be, so that you can take shortcuts whenever possible to save yourself a lot of trials, errors, and frankly, headaches. Show up, do the work, and I will pave the way for you.</p>
      <p>Making decisions from a place of fear isn't going to help you achieve those massive goals you've got, is it?</p>   
    </div>



      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded editable" data-cms-source="/index.html" data-cms-index="7">
        <h5> But... I already bought products that promised the same thing and i'm still looking for answers</h5>
        <p>Well, that's the entire reason we created the IG Creator Retreat. The difference between this retreat and any other is that we didn't luck into any of this. We had no job and no back up plan. We forced ourselves to learn how to make money from Instagram. </p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on follower count, we focus on all the other aspects of content creation and how to show your value to your audience and to brands. We know creators who have less than 5k followers, making 5-figure months while others with over 100k aren't making a cent…. It's all about having a strategy and a plan.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded  editable" data-cms-source="/index.html" data-cms-index="8">
        <h5>But... I've tried everything already</h5>
        <p>You might think you've tried everything already, but we aren't buying that - sorry!</p>
        <p>You might have seen what others were doing, tried and tested a few things a few times, thrown a ton of spaghetti at the wall and then given up when it didn't stick.</p>
        <p>We've been there and know that there are a couple reasons things might not have worked out for you in the past. There could be an issue with your branding, or there could be an issue with your monetization strategy.</p>
        <p>If there's an issue with your branding, it could mean you aren't attracting the right audience or speaking to the right people. If there's an issue with your monetization strategy you'll never be able to expand your income as a creator.</p>

    <div class="grid service-text left">
      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded editable" data-cms-source="/index.html" data-cms-index="9">
        <h5>But… I don't have an audience</h5>
        <p>Perfect! Even more reasons for you to join us in Thailand! SO many people think that you need thousands and thousands of followers in order to make money as a content creator and that's simply NOT true! What you DO need is an engaged audience and a perfect monetization strategy. The IG Creator retreat program teaches you how to achieve both! </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded  editable" data-cms-source="/index.html" data-cms-index="10">
        <h5>But... I don't have time for this</h5>
        <p>This IG Creator retreat gives you the knowledge on how to work for yourself, on your own time, so it just depends on how soon you want that to happen! I promise, your future self will be thanking your present self in no time when you have all the time in the world to travel more, when you reach financial stability to be able to finally buy that property, or give your family a better life!</p>
      </div>



      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded editable" data-cms-source="/index.html" data-cms-index="11">
        <h5>To sum things up:</h5>
        <p>Over our careers we've put all our effort into growing an engaged audience and built successful online businesses that have allowed us location and financial freedom. And guess what - it works! We're so confident in the information/strategies we teach that if you implement what you learn you will make your money back over and over again.</p>
        <p>This program doesn't cost you money, it's a return on investment. Meaning IT PAYS YOU!</p>
